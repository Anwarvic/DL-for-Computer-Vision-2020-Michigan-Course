# Assignment 2
In this assignment, you will implement various image classification models, based on the SVM / Softmax / Two-layer Neural Network. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Implement and apply a Softmax classifier
- Implement and apply a Two-layer Neural Network classifier
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- Practice implementing vectorized gradient code by checking against naive implementations, and using numeric gradient checking

## Q1: Linear Classifiers (60 points)
The notebook `linear_classifier.ipynb` will walk you through implementing SVM and Softmax classifier. You are required to write code on `linear_classifier.py`.

## Q2: Two-layer Neural Network (40 points)
The notebook `two_layer_net.ipynb` will walk you through implementing a two-layer neural network-based classifier. Your implementation will go to `two_layer_net.py`.


## Steps
### 1. Download the zipped assignment file
Click [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/assignments/A1.zip) to download the starter code

### 2. Unzip all and open the Colab file from the Drive
Once you unzip the downloaded content, please upload the folder to your Google Drive. Then, open each `*.ipynb` notebook file with Google Colab by right-clicking the `*.ipynb` file. No installation or setup is required! For more information on using Colab, please see our [Colab tutorial](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/colab.html).

### 3. Open your corresponding `*.py` from Google Colab and work on the assignment
Next, we recommend editing your `*.py` file on Google Colab, set the ipython notebook and the code side by side. Work through the notebook, executing cells and implementing the codes in the `*.py` file as indicated. You can save your work, both `*.ipynb` and `*.py`, in Google Drive (click “File” -> “Save”) and resume later if you don’t want to complete it all at once.
